Design and implement a food delivery management system for a catering company. 
1. Requirements
Consider an application OrderManagement for processing client orders for a warehouse. Relational 
databases are used to store the products, the clients and the orders. Furthermore, the application should 
be structured in packages using a layered architecture presented in the support presentation
(ASSIGNMENT_3_SUPPORT_PRESENTATION.pdf) and should use (minimally) the following 
classes: 
- Model classes - represent the data models of the application
- Business Logic classes - contain the application logic
- Presentation classes – GUI related classes
- Data access classes - classes that contain the access to the database
Note: Other classes and packages can be added to implement the full functionality of the application.
